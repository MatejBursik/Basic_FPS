# Basic 3D Game
Trying to make a basic 3D Game using ray casting with a similar approach to [Wolfenstein 3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D)

## Issues
- coloring walls has some issues, overall approach to displaying perspective needs to be rethinked
- slow movements and rotation, probably caused by incorrect use of elapsed_time, temporary solution (speed: 5000.0)
