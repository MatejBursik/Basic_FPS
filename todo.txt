Refactor
- shader_program.rs
- v_attribute.rs
- window.rs
- README.md

Test
- remake the ray_caster into the new system with shaders and rectangles instead of lines of walls

Issues
- coloring walls has some issues, overall approach to displaying perspective needs to be rethinked
- need to provide a fragment shader for the lines representing the walls, not all drivers provide a default
- slow movements and rotation, probably caused by incorrect use of elapsed_time, temporary solution (speed: 5000.0)
